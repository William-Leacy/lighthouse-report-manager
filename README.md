# Lighthouse Report Manager

## Description
Simple crud application that saves Google Page Speed Insights reports under a project name. </br>
Utilizes Lighthouse npm module to generate the report. 

## Links
You can access the application here:

## Future Work
The project needs middleware for Delete routes so that when an object is deleted from its model, it is also deleted from the models that reference's it</br>

The project needs error handing on input files, especially when entering URL for that is used to generate a report.</br>

I would like to reference the user's model in projects so that a user can add other members to a project. With the current version, all users can see all projects.</br>

My original plan is to also dynamically add data from a collection of reports for urls to a d3.js  multi-line chart. This would give a visual look at the progress on a webpage.</br>

## Code organization
The project trys to follow the coding style guide provied by [AirBnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

## Design pattern and System design approach
MVC is the design pattern for the project. The mongo models are using a mongoose reference Schema.</br>
A four-layer nested router was implemented for navigation throughout the project model to get to the reports.</br>

When generating a report the lighthouse npm package used chrome in a headless mode to use its lighthouse api.</br>
This report is then saved a a string variable and saved to the mongo database

bootstrap CSS framework was used to style the application </br>
